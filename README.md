## Question 1
```
Time Spent
SpecFlow: 3 Hours 
Watir: 1 Hour
-----------------
Total: 4 Hours
```
Before I talk about the solution side I would like to explain why their are two projects in the folder. Understanding your requirment for the demonstration of c# and Specflow skills I wanted to provide that to you. However it has been a long time since I have used specflow (lets just say it was somewhere early in version 1) and just about as long since I have written any c#. Given that I wanted to also provide something a little more familiare to myself in watir, where I can demonstrate concepts and good use of the tools like cucumber. 
That being said I will go through common improvements I would make given the time (or if it was being deployed to a production environment).
